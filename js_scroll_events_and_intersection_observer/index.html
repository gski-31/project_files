            <p> It is a period of civil wars in the galaxy. A brave alliance of underground freedom fighters has
                challenged the tyranny and oppression of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE.</p>
            <p>Striking from a fortress hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy, rebel spaceships have won their
                first victory in a battle with the powerful Imperial Starfleet. The EMPIRE fears that another defeat
                could bring a thousand more solar systems into the rebellion, and Imperial control over the galaxy would
                be lost forever.</p>
            <p>To crush the rebellion once and for all, the EMPIRE is constructing a sinister new battle
                station.Powerful enough to destroy an entire planet, its completion spells certain doom for the
                champions of freedom.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have
                driven the Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy.</p>
            <p>Evading the dreaded Imperial Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker has established
                a new secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth.</p>
            <p>The evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has dispatched thousands of remote
                probes into the far reaches of space....</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo
                from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt.</p>
            <p>Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a new armored space
                station even more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star.</p>
            <p>When completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of rebels struggling to
                restore freedom to the galaxy....</p>
