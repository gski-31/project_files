            <h3>Official Bio</h3>
            <p>&ldquo;Anger feels very passionately about making sure things are fair for Riley. He has a fiery spirit and tends to explode (literally) when things don&rsquo;t go as planned. He is quick to overreact and has little patience for life&rsquo;s&nbsp;imperfections.&rdquo;</p>

            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>Anger is very serious, short, somewhat antagonistic, very reluctant to express sadness or happiness, bitter and hoarse. He has a fiery spirit and tends to explode (literally) when things do not go as planned. As explained by Joy, he really cares that things are fair and differs from Fear, as Joy differs from Sadness. Despite his intention to fix things, he sometimes acts impulsively and does things his own way, like Joy did, resulting in more&nbsp;harm.</p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>Anger is the shortest of the Emotions. He has crimson skin, a bald head, and tan oval eyes. He wears a white shirt and a gray tie with red triangles separated in the middle by a zigzagging line of yellow, as well as a brown belt, red trousers and gray shoes. When angry, volcanic bursts of flame burst from his&nbsp;scalp.</p>
