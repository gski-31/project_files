                <p>It seems impossible to be a software developer these days without using JavaScript. The first one in
                    the list is JavaScript, it seems impossible to imagine software development without JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Looking at the Stack Overflow’s 2018 Developer Survey, JavaScript is the most popular language among
                    developers successively for 6 years. And around 65% of them have used this language in the past
                    year.</p>
                <p>Primarily, JavaScript is light weighed, interpreted and plays a major role in front-end development.
                    Even some of the major social media platforms believe that JavaScript provides an easy way to create
                    interactive web pages smoothly and is career-driven.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is most preferred because of its compatibility with all the major browsers and is really
                    flexible with the syntax it holds. Being a Front-end language, JavaScript is also used on the
                    server-side through Node.js.</p>
                <p>Above all make JavaScript loveliest programming language among the beginners.</p>
                <ul><code>
                <li>Front-end web development</li>

                <p>This may surprise you; I have kept python on number #2, in many of the surveys it is positioned on
                    number #5. But, I will definitely let you believe, here’s why?</p>
                <p>Python is one of the general purpose, user-friendly programming language here on my list. What makes
                    it so? Like Java, Python syntax is clear, intuitive and almost similar to the English language.
                    Python’s “object-based” subset is somewhere similar to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>According to Stack Overflow, there is one section which says “To be adopted or migrated to be—or to
                    migrate too soon”, and for python, it’s 12% which is highest. Broadly, people who have migrated to
                    python are close to 42%, which signifies it to be at number #2.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in making your career in back-end development, like Django – Open source
                    framework, is written in python, which makes it easy to learn and feature-packed, yet popular. Also,
                    python has a variety of applications that make it a versatile and powerful.</p>
                <p>Being so popular in areas like scientific computing, and machine learning and engineering, Python
                    supports a programming style that uses simple functions and variables without much interrogating in
                    class definitions.</p>

                <header>java</header>
                <p>If anybody asks why java, most frequent sentence comes up would be “write once, run everywhere” –
                    Java has been the ruling programming language for the last 20 years. Java is 99% object-oriented and
                    is robust as java objects contain no references to data external to themselves. It is simpler than
                    C++ because Java uses automatic memory allocation and garbage collection.</p>
                <p>Java is highly cross-platform compatible or platform independent. Since you can code anywhere (I mean
                    on all devices), compile into low-level machine code, and finally, execute on any platform using JVM
                    – Java Virtual Machine (which is platform dependent).</p>
                <p>Java forms the base for the Android operating system and opted around 90% fortune 500 companies for
                    making a variety of back-end applications. I would not hesitate for taking the biggest sensation
                    Apache Hadoop data processing, run by Amazon Web Services and Windows Azure.</p>
                <p>With so many good reasons and a wide range of business applications, possessing immense flexibility
                    and java is all time beginners’ favorite.</p>

                <p>“Old is gold” – C has proved this quote in different ways. Being introduced in the late 1970s, C has
                    made a strong contribution to the world of programming.</p>
                <p>C has been the parent language of a handful; some are either derived from C or inspired by its
                    syntax, constructs, and paradigms, including Java, Objective-C, and C#.</p>
                <p>Even, nowadays, it is seen, whenever there is a need to build high-performance applications, C
                    remains the most popular choice.</p>
                <p>Linux OS is C based. And CPP is the hybrid version of C. C++ is an object-oriented programming
                    language and which is built on C; therefore it is preferred over others for designing higher-level
                    applications.</p>
                <p>C++ is seeing as more performing than dynamically typed languages because the code is type-checked
                    before it is executed on real grounds. Core areas of developments are Virtual Reality, gaming,
                    computer graphics etc.</p>

                <p>This fact would seriously amaze you, the language which was created for a purpose of maintaining
                    Personal Home Page (PHP) for Rasmus, have actually taken over around 83% of websites globally by
                    today.</p>
                <p>PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a general-purpose programming language. Clearly, PHP is a
                    scripting language, which runs on a server, and it is used to create web pages written in HTML. It
                    is popular because it is free, cheap, easy to set up and simple to use for new programmers.</p>
                <p>PHP is a very strong option for web developers around the globe. It is widely used to create dynamic
                    web page content, and images used on websites. It’s hitting on number #5 because of its broad range
                    of usage. Also, PHP is well dressed for WordPress CMS (Content Management System).</p>
                <p>One of the reason, it has lagged down to number #5, PHP downgrades the website performance and
                    affects the loading time.</p>

                <header>swift</header>
                <p>Next on the list is Swift. As smooth as its name, Swift is a general-purpose, open-source, compiled
                    programming language developed by Apple Inc. If you are looking develop to native iOS or Mac OS apps
                    then, Swift is barely needed for its development.</p>
                <p>Swift is deeply influenced by Python and Ruby and was designed to be beginner-friendly and fun to
                    use. Swift is considered to be a faster, more secure, and easier to read and debug than its
                    predecessor Objective-C.</p>
                <p>Unlike Objective-C, Swift requires less code, resembles with natural English. Hence, it becomes
                    easier for existing techies from JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, and C++ to switch to Swift without
                    hassle.</p>
                <p>Besides this, some of the challenges are its limited talent pool. You may not find many Swift
                    developers around you as compared to other open source languages. Recent surveys say, only 8.1% of
                    the 78, 000 respondents use Swift, which is lesser compared to others. And due to frequent updates,
                    Swift is considered to be less stable with every new release.</p>

                <p>C-sharp is a powerful, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in 2000. C-sharp
                    is utilized in developing desktop applications and more recently, Windows 8/10 applications and
                    requires a .NET framework to function.</p>
                <p>Microsoft developed C# as a rival to Java. Actually, Sun did not want the interference of Microsoft
                    to make changes in Java. So, it was created.</p>
                <p>C# has a variety of features which makes it easier to learn for the beginners. The code is
                    consistent, and logical as compared to C++.</p>
                <p>Spotting errors in C# are easy as it is statically typed language, where the code is checked before
                    turning it to an application.</p>
                <p>In short, it is perfect to develop web applications, desktop application and also proved itself in
                    VR, 2D, and 3D gaming. Cross-platform tools like Xamarin have written in C# makes it all devices
