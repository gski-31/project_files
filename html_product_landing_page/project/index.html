                    <h2>Mario</h2>
                    <p>Mario (Japanese: マリオ Hepburn: Mario, pronounced [maɾi.o]; English: /ˈmɑːrioʊ, ˈmær-/, Italian:
                        [ˈmaːrjo]) is a fictional character in the Mario video game franchise, owned by Nintendo and
                        created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Acting as the company's mascot, as
                        well as being the eponymous protagonist of the series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video
                        games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the
                        Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center upon rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa
                        villain Bowser. His fraternal twin brother and sidekick is Luigi.</p>
                    <p>With more than 500 million units sold worldwide, the overall Mario franchise is the best-selling
                        video game franchise of all time.[1][2] Outside of the Super Mario platform series, other Mario
                        genres include the Mario Kart racing series, sports games such as the Mario Tennis and Mario
                        Golf series, role-playing games such as Mario & Luigi, Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario, and
                        educational games such as Mario Is Missing!, Mario's Time Machine and Mario Teaches Typing. The
                        franchise has branched into several media, including television shows, film, comics, and
                        licensed merchandise. Since 1990, Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet.</p>

                    <h2>Luigi</h2>
                    <p>Luigi (Japanese: ルイージ Hepburn: Ruīji, pronounced [ɾɯ.iːʑi]; English: /luˈiːdʒi/ loo-EE-jee,
                        Italian: [luˈiːdʒi]) is a fictional character featured in video games and related media released
                        by Nintendo. Created by prominent game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, Luigi is portrayed as the
                        slightly younger but taller fraternal twin brother of Nintendo's mascot Mario, and appears in
                        many games throughout the Mario franchise, often as a sidekick to his older brother.</p>
                    <p>Luigi first appeared in the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros. as the character controlled by the
                        second player, and retained this role in Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario
                        World, and other titles. The first game where he was available as a primary character was Super
                        Mario Bros. 2. In more recent appearances, Luigi's role became increasingly restricted to
                        spinoffs such as the Mario Party and Mario Kart series, though he has been featured in a
                        starring role on four occasions: first in the 1991 educational game Mario Is Missing!, in
                        Luigi's Mansion for the GameCube in 2001, in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon for the Nintendo 3DS in
                        2013, and Luigi's Mansion 3 for Nintendo Switch in 2019. In all four of these games, he is
                        called upon to act as the hero because Mario, the usual hero within the franchise, is in need of
                        rescue. Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three DiC TV series based on the NES and
                        Super NES games.</p>
                    <p>Originally developed as a palette swap of Mario with a green color scheme instead of red, Luigi
                        has since developed a personality and style of his own. As his role in the Mario series
                        progressed, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, taller and thinner than his
                        brother. Nintendo called the period of March 2013 to March 2014 "The Year of Luigi" to
                        commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character's existence. Correspondingly, games
                        released in 2013 emphasised Luigi, such as Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, Mario & Luigi: Dream
                        Team, Dr. Luigi, and the level pack New Super Luigi U for New Super Mario Bros U. An unlockable
                        Luigi-themed version of Mario Bros. titled Luigi Bros. was also included with Super Mario 3D
                        World.</p>

                    <h2>Wario</h2>
                    <p>Wario (Japanese: ワリオ Hepburn: Wario, pronounced [ɰaɾi.o]; English: /ˈwɑːrioʊ, ˈwær-/) is a
                        fictional character in Nintendo's Mario series, designed as an arch-rival to Mario. He first
                        appeared in the 1992 Game Boy game Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins as the main antagonist and
                        final boss. His name is a portmanteau of Mario's name and the Japanese word warui (悪い), meaning
                        "bad". Wario was designed by Hiroji Kiyotake, and is voiced by Charles Martinet, who voices many
                        other characters in the series, such as Mario, Luigi, and Waluigi.</p>
                    <p>Wario has become the protagonist and antihero of the Wario Land and WarioWare series, spanning
                        handheld and console markets. In addition to appearances in spin-offs in the Mario series, he
                        appears in cameos for Kirby Super Star Ultra, Densetsu no Stafy 3 and Pilotwings 64. He has also
                        been featured in other media such as the Super Mario Adventures graphic novel. The character has
                        received a largely positive critical reception.</p>

                    <h2>Bowser</h2>
                    <p>Bowser (クッパ Kuppa, "Koopa"),[1] or King Koopa, is a fictional character and the main antagonist
                        of Nintendo's Mario franchise. In Japan, the character bears the title of Daimaō (大魔王 Great
                        Demon King).[2] In the U.S., the character was first referred to as "Bowser, King of the Koopas"
                        and "the sorcerer king" in the instruction manual.[3] Bowser is the leader of the turtle-like
                        Koopa race, and has been the archenemy of Mario since his first appearance, in the 1985 video
                        game Super Mario Bros.</p>
                    <p>His ultimate goals are to kidnap Princess Peach, defeat Mario, and conquer the Mushroom Kingdom.
                        Since his debut, he has appeared in almost every Mario franchise game, usually serving as the
                        main antagonist. Bowser is voiced by Kenny James. In addition to his usual animated and video
                        game appearances, he also appears in the 1993 live-action film, where he is portrayed by Dennis
                        Hopper.</p>
